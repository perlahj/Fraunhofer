- If you want to have quotes in the request you have to put in the quotes **before** you create the request
- If you don't put in any date in "Quote issued", then it takes the current date   
- After the request has been created, you can see it in the request table on the frontpage

## Request without quotes
----------------------------

- The only field that is required is the description. However, more information makes it easier to process the order

## Process purchase order
----------------------------

- Go to process order and choose the correct request the order is for
- Possible to edit order number, expected delivery date, net terms, quotes
- Once you have added the order item you can see the printout for the order and close the request
- Now the purchase order is "in progress" until it is "received"

## Order received
---------------------------

- Once the order has been received, go to the "received" view and put in a final inspection comment for every order item
- You can add scans / invoices to the purchase order as well
- Finally you rate the purchase order, based on timeliness, quality and price
- Those ratings will affect the supplier rating
- Then you click "package received" and if you don't specify a date, the database assumes it was received on current day

## Security levels
---------------------------

- 2: General usage.
- 3: Process an order. Edit supplier.
- 4: View forecast and overview. Approve orders over $1000. Delete supplier.
